The archaeological remains that were discovered illustrate several types of continued occupation at the site. A large stone quarry, rock-cut tombs used as necropolis and an enclosed mud-brick settlement were all found within the boundaries. George Wilkinson, Robert Hay, Nestor Lâ€™Hote and Bonomi traveled the Gebel el-Haridi region during the nineteenth century. These men recorded what they saw as they travelled through the region, such as Ptolemaic quarries, Christian brick ruins, tombs, and mutilated statues.","<a href='sites/gebel-el-haridi/gebel-el-haridi.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"

Their country has become a place for tourism and their lands have been taken from them. They are fighting for the return of their lands the only way they know how, with blood quantum. They are using their percentage of Native Hawaiian blood to claim back lands and this is helpful to their cause, but harmful to other Native Hawaiians who fall short of the legal blood quantum.","<a href='sites/hawaiian-bld-quant.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"

It is a natural, cyclical phenomenon, however, humans have exacerbated the process immensely. Due to careless human activity, polar ice caps are melting and increasing the sea levels. This often goes unseen by inland residents, but the coast is suffering.

On some occasions, however, the fires will persist until the first snow fall of the season. The northwest includes states such as Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, and Montana, but other states, such as California, Colorado, and (occasionally) Arizona, also suffer from frequent wildfires. Due to these fires, Indigenous communities may suffer from loss of economical income, their livelihoods, their homes, family members, livestock, and many other factors. Some of the most detrimental fires in recent years to federally recognized tribes includes the Spotted Eagle Fire (MT), Carpenter Road Fire (WA), Cougar Creek Fire (WA), and the North Star Fire (WA).","<a href='sites/wildfires-in-the-us-northwest/wildfires-in-the-us-northwest.html'> MORE DETAILS</a>"

The tourism industry completely contradicts and destroys its host culture while simultaneously bleeding the culture dry of its natural resources, social and economic standing, and cultural values by turning their culture into a commodity. It demonstrates the moral injustice of consciously putting financial gain ahead of preserving and respecting its native host culture. Native Hawaiian communities live in economic and political degradation with tourism industries encroaching on their rights to natural resources, land, and basic living conditions. The very institution that is completely dependent on Hawaiian culture is knowingly worsening the preservation of its hosts beautiful culture.","<a href='sites/native-hawaiians-and-tourism/native-hawaiians-and-tourism.html'>MOREDETAILS</a>"

Since the beginning of colonization we have seen abuse from people in higher positions towards indigenous people, which is still prevalent today. This abuse and need of power over minority groups is due to lack of acknowledgement from the government to put an end to this contemporary issue and the racist views our government was built on.

36.278995,-109.860049,<h3>Cultural Appropriation</h3>,<h4>Navajo</h4>,"[In the year 2012, the American clothing company Urban Outfitters released a line of clothes and accessories under the label ?Navajo? or ?Navaho.? This was distributed to all of their subsidiaries, including the stores Anthropologie and Free People. Some of the products that were under the ?Navajo? name were pairs of underwear labeled ?Navajo Hipster Panty? and a liquor flask. After all of the stereotypes connecting Native Americans with alcohol abuse, this turned into just one examples of the extreme distaste and ignorance that Urban Outfitters displayed. Without surprise, the Navajo Nation responded quickly to the appropriation, and filed a lawsuit against the company for using their name and displaying false information about Navajo culture. Unfortunately, these is a theme in big companies all throughout the Americas as well as the world, and definitely not a first offense for this company. Within my ?This is Indian Country? project I will be exploring further how the Navajo Indians respond to cultural appropriation, and give examples of the ways cultural appropriation is still a large and prominent part of today?s world.]",
